The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal\\ncompetitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative\\nprice and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and\\naccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables\\nand accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have\\nsigniﬁcant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service\\nofferings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced\\nproducts and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have\\naggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to\\nprovide products at little or no proﬁt or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide\\ncontent to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces\\nsigniﬁcant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or\\ncollaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\\nSupply of Components\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with\\nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many\\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\\nshortage and signiﬁcant commodity pricing ﬂuctuations.\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by\\nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have\\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to\\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the\\nCompany will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\\nResearch and Development\\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s\\nability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely ﬂow of competitive products,\\nservices and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing\\nproducts and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D”), licensing of\\nintellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\\nIntellectual Property\\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware,\\naccessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of\\nintellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such\\nintellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such\\nownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\\nThe Company regularly ﬁles patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its\\nresearch, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time,\\nthe Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single\\nintellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and services. The Company believes the\\nduration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include'),\n",

Additionally, new product and service introductions can signiﬁcantly impact net sales, cost of\\nsales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect\\ndistribution channels as these channels are ﬁlled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an\\nolder product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and\\ndistributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nHuman Capital\\nThe Company believes that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and retain the best\\ntalent. The Company works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members, so that its\\npeople can do the best work of their lives. As of September\\xa028, 2024, the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time\\nequivalent employees.\\nCompensation and Beneﬁts\\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the\\nCompany’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their\\nneeds and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a\\nwide variety of beneﬁts for employees around the world, including health, wellness and time away.\\nGrowth and Development\\nThe Company invests in resources to help its people develop and achieve their career goals. The Company offers programs\\nthrough Apple University on leadership, management and inﬂuence, as well as Apple culture and values. Team members can\\nalso take advantage of online classes for business, technical and personal development, as well as learning opportunities to\\nsupport their well-being.\\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of\\nharassment or discrimination.\\nInclusion and Diversity\\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities\\nit serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and\\nsupport equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\\nEngagement\\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an\\nopen, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to\\ncome to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee\\nsentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\\nHealth and Safety\\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identiﬁes potential workplace\\nrisks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security\\nand crisis management training, and by putting speciﬁc programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard\\nenvironments.

Substantially all of the Company’s\\nmanufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South\\nKorea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods,\\ntechnology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly\\nsigniﬁcant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a signiﬁcant portion of its\\nrevenues and/or has signiﬁcant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company’s products\\nand the components and raw materials that go into them, and can require the Company to take various actions, including\\nchanging suppliers, restructuring business relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and distribute affected products,\\nservices and third-party applications to its customers. Changing the Company’s business and supply chain in accordance with\\nnew or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s\\noperations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company\\nmay not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments,\\nincluding the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions affecting the Company’s business. If disputes\\nand conﬂicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be signiﬁcantly more severe and restrictive\\nand could materially adversely affect the Company’s business.\\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract\\nmanufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is resulting in\\ncertain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In addition, the\\nCompany’s and its suppliers’ operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by ﬁre, power shortages, nuclear\\npower plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other\\ncybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company’s control. For example, global\\nsupply chains can be highly concentrated and geopolitical tensions or conﬂict could result in signiﬁcant disruptions.\\nSuch events can make it difﬁcult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create\\ndelays and inefﬁciencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s\\nservice offerings, increase the Company’s costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.\\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While\\nthe Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur\\nand could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation.\\nMajor public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the\\nfuture materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products;\\nthe imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight\\nservices and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales\\nand distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays\\nin production ramps of new products and development of new services.\\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience signiﬁcant\\nexpenditures to resume operations, and lose signiﬁcant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the\\nsupply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any\\nnegative consequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such\\ninsurance coverage may be insufﬁcient to cover all losses that may arise.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 6'),\n",

The Company has also outsourced\\nmuch of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the\\nCompany’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future\\nhave an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the\\nCompany’s ﬂexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for\\nproduct defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-\\nwarranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While\\nthe Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur\\nfrom time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and ﬁnancial\\ncondition.\\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many\\ncomponents, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for ﬁnal assembly of substantially all of the Company’s\\nhardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of\\ncomponents or ﬁnished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to ﬁnal destinations can be\\ndisrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures,\\ncommercial disputes, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, trade and other international\\ndisputes, geopolitical tensions, or conﬂict.\\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners,\\nand has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements\\nhelp ensure the supply of components and ﬁnished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe ﬁnancial\\nproblems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be disrupted or terminated, and the recoverability of\\nmanufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\\nChanges or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve signiﬁcant risks and\\nuncertainties, including exposure to additional regulatory and operational risks.\\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufﬁcient quantities on\\ncommercially reasonable terms.\\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to signiﬁcant\\nsupply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to\\nindustry-wide shortages and signiﬁcant commodity pricing ﬂuctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s\\nbusiness, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past\\nexperienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company’s ability to obtain sufﬁcient quantities\\nof components and products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the\\nCompany has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be\\nable to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. In addition, component suppliers may suffer from poor\\nﬁnancial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting\\nthe Company’s ability to obtain sufﬁcient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, the\\nCompany remains subject to signiﬁcant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its\\nbusiness, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.\\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product\\nuses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing\\ncapacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any\\nnumber of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of\\ncomponents customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing\\nproduct has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the\\nCompany, the Company’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition have been adversely affected and future delays\\nor constraints could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition. The\\nCompany’s business and ﬁnancial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to\\nobtain sufﬁcient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufﬁcient quantities from an alternative source.'),\n",

Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues\\nthat can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also\\nexist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s\\nproducts unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the\\nCompany’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings\\ncan have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time\\nthe Company’s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. The introduction of new\\nand complex technologies, such as artiﬁcial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety risks, including exposing\\nusers to harmful, inaccurate or other negative content and experiences. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to\\ndetect and ﬁx all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread\\ntechnical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. Errors, bugs and vulnerabilities can be\\nexploited by third parties, compromising the safety and security of a user’s device. In addition, the Company can be exposed to\\nproduct liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modiﬁcations, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or\\nintangible assets, and signiﬁcant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory ﬁnes. Quality problems\\ncan adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s\\nreputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new\\nproduct and service introductions and lost sales.\\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to\\npurchase commitment cancellation risk.\\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated\\ndemand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for\\norders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its\\nsuppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be\\nrecoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which\\nthe carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory\\nprepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company\\nwill not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence\\nin the industries in which the Company competes.\\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments.\\nManufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for\\nperiods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price\\nchanges, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufﬁcient amounts of\\ncomponents or products, or not fully utilize ﬁrm purchase commitments.\\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on\\ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all.\\nThe Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires\\nlicenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently\\ncompetes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the\\nCompany’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to\\ntime, the Company has been notiﬁed that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.\\nBased on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally\\nbe obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on\\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such\\nintellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can require the Company to modify certain products, services or\\nfeatures or preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 9'),\n",

There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain\\nsoftware applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be\\ndeveloped and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products.\\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the\\ndevelopers’ perception and analysis of the relative beneﬁts of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services\\nfor the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for\\npersonal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on\\nfactors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected\\nfuture growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\\nThe Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers\\nless inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to\\ndeveloping and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on\\nthese competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices can suffer.\\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its\\nproducts. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party\\ndevelopers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of\\nthese changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisﬁed customers and\\nlower customer demand for the Company’s products.\\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications,\\ndevelopers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. Where applicable, the Company retains a commission from\\nsales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has\\nmade changes to its products and services, including taking actions in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and\\nlegal and regulatory requirements, and expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the\\nCompany has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the\\niOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. The Company has also implemented changes to iOS,\\niPadOS, the App Store and Safari in the European Union (“EU”) as it seeks to comply with the Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”),\\nincluding new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS\\nand iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s operating systems, and additional tools and\\napplication programming interfaces (“APIs”) for developers. Changes to the Company’s products and services could materially\\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition, including if such business changes result\\nin reduced App Store or other sales, reductions in the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales, or if the\\nrate of the commission is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated.\\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content available\\non commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of\\noperations and ﬁnancial condition.\\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or\\noffer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate speciﬁc content into the Company’s own services.\\nThe licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the\\ncontinuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers\\nand distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difﬁcult or\\nimpossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may\\nseek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a\\nwide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition\\nfor talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers.\\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security\\nsolutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions.\\nThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely\\n®'),\n",

In addition, agreements\\nentered into by the Company sometimes include indemniﬁcation provisions which can subject the Company to costs and\\ndamages in the event of a claim against an indemniﬁed third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government\\ninvestigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations,\\nhas generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a signiﬁcant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and\\nnew claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and\\nother patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on\\nallegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending\\ninfringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these\\nactions frequently seek broad injunctive relief and substantial damages.\\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be\\nexpensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company\\nmay enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance\\nsuch agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also signiﬁcantly\\nincrease the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and\\nlimit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services.\\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against\\nthe Company or an indemniﬁed third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s\\nresults of operations and ﬁnancial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an\\noutcome can result in signiﬁcant monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or proﬁts, remedial corporate measures or\\ninjunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change\\nits business practices and limit the Company’s ability to develop, manufacture, use, import or offer for sale certain products and\\nservices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and ﬁnancial\\ncondition.\\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufﬁcient to\\ncover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to\\npotential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust;\\nprivacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; ﬁnancial services\\nand technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and\\nartiﬁcial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, ﬁlm and digital content;\\navailability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade;\\nforeign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and\\nenvironmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely\\naffect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or\\nfeature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company’s products and services, impacting customer demand for\\nthe Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s business or supply chain. New and changing\\nlaws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These\\nrisks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including\\nhealth and ﬁnancial services, or as the Company expands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artiﬁcial\\nintelligence features, and must navigate new legal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies.

For\\nexample, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the\\nCompany has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no\\nassurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the\\nCompany’s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the\\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.\\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose\\nthe Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s\\nbusiness.\\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on\\nenvironmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas\\nemissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its\\ngoals and initiatives through its various non-ﬁnancial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other\\ncommunications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of the\\nCompany’s announced goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-\\nparty performance or data that is outside the Company’s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its\\nannounced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the\\nCompany’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives,\\nadhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state and international environmental, social and governance laws and\\nregulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory\\nproceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations,\\nﬁnancial condition and stock price.\\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and\\nregulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and\\npenalties.\\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation,\\ncompetition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes\\nin the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers\\nwithin apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.\\nThe Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safariin the EU as it seeks to comply with the\\nDMA, including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution\\nfor iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s operating systems, and additional\\ntools and APIs for developers. The Company has also continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to\\nfeedback and engagement with the European Commission (the “Commission”). Although the Company’s compliance plan is\\nintended to address the DMA’s obligations, it has been challenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private\\nlitigants. The DMA provides for signiﬁcant ﬁnes and penalties for noncompliance, and other jurisdictions may seek to require the\\nCompany to make changes to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce\\nnew privacy and security risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain.\\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which\\ncan result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially\\nadverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition. For example, the Company is subject\\nto civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance\\nsmartphones” and “smartphones” generally in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of\\ninvestigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are\\nresolved against the Company, the Company can be exposed to signiﬁcant ﬁnes and may be required to make further changes\\nto its business practices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations\\nand ﬁnancial condition.\\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become\\nsubject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the\\nCompany’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business,\\nresults of operations and ﬁnancial condition.

Changes to the Company’s\\nbusiness practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings can negatively impact\\nthe reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the\\nCompany’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market\\nacceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\\nThe Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations\\nregarding data protection.\\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention,\\nsecurity and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party\\ntransactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several\\njurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have\\nlaws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with\\nemerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future\\nrequire the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in signiﬁcant penalties or legal liability.\\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information\\nprovided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to\\ncomply with these public statements or with federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could\\nresult in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts,\\npenalties could include ongoing audit requirements and signiﬁcant legal liability.\\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the\\nCompany is also subject to speciﬁc obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health\\ndata, ﬁnancial data and biometric data. Health data and ﬁnancial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach\\nnotiﬁcation requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance\\nwith these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or ﬁnancial\\ndata is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or ﬁnancial institutions,\\nthe Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses,\\nand can also incur signiﬁcant fees or ﬁnes.\\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder\\ninformation is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur\\nsigniﬁcant fees or ﬁnes if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also\\nexperience a signiﬁcant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow\\npayment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation,\\nresults of operations and ﬁnancial condition.\\nFinancial Risks\\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to ﬂuctuate.\\nThe Company’s proﬁt margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example,\\nthe gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary signiﬁcantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross\\nmargins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global\\nproduct pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased\\ncompetition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product\\nlife cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing,\\nacquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty\\ncosts effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent\\nthat regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; ﬂuctuations in foreign exchange rates;\\ninﬂation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or\\nservices with lower proﬁt margins.

Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that\\ninclude components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be\\nmaterially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate ﬂuctuations.\\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign\\ncurrency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing\\ndemand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to\\nraise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross\\nmargins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.\\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneﬁcial to the Company’s foreign\\ncurrency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its\\nforeign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the beneﬁt. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may\\nincrease the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to\\nﬂuctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a\\nportion, of the adverse ﬁnancial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges\\nare in place.\\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and ﬂuctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, ﬁnancial results, market and\\neconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate ﬂuctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of\\nthe Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may ﬂuctuate substantially. Although the Company has not\\nrealized signiﬁcant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future ﬂuctuations in their value could result\\nin signiﬁcant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.\\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and\\nprepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic\\nconditions worsen.\\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers,\\nretailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and\\neducation, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not\\ncovered by collateral, third-party bank support or ﬁnancing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a signiﬁcant portion of the\\nCompany’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to\\ncredit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks\\nmay be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by\\noutsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble ﬁnal products for the Company. In\\naddition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory\\ncomponents. As of September\\xa028, 2024, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term\\nsupply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has\\nprocedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term\\nprepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure\\nto additional tax liabilities.\\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a\\nnumber of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized.

The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome\\nresulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the\\noutcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the\\nCompany’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of\\noperations and ﬁnancial condition could be materially adversely affected.\\nGeneral Risks\\nThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.\\nThe Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future.\\nAdditionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced\\nextreme stock price and volume ﬂuctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these\\ncompanies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in\\na given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reﬂect\\nexpectations of future growth and proﬁtability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reﬂect expectations that\\nits cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully\\nconsummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), and the\\nCompany’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any speciﬁc number of shares. If the Company fails to\\nmeet expectations related to future growth, proﬁtability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of\\nthe Company’s stock may decline signiﬁcantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor conﬁdence and\\nemployee retention.\\nItem 1B.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Unresolved Staff Comments\\nNone.\\nItem 1C.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Cybersecurity\\nThe Company’s management, led by its Head of Corporate Information Security, has overall responsibility for identifying,\\nassessing and managing any material risks from cybersecurity threats.

The Company’s Head of Corporate Information Security has extensive\\nknowledge and skills gained from over 25 years of experience in the cybersecurity industry, including serving in leadership\\npositions at other large technology companies and leading the Company’s Information Security team since 2016.\\nThe Company’s Information Security team coordinates with teams across the Company to prevent, respond to and manage\\nsecurity incidents, and engages third parties, as appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of its security\\nprocesses and incident response. A dedicated Supplier Trust team manages information security risks the Company is exposed\\nto through its supplier relationships. The Company has processes to log, track, address, and escalate for further assessment\\nand report, as appropriate, cybersecurity incidents across the Company and its suppliers to senior management and the Audit\\nand Finance Committee (the “Audit Committee”) of the Board. The Company’s enterprise risk management program is designed\\nto identify, assess, and monitor the Company’s business risks, including ﬁnancial, operational, compliance and reputational risks,\\nand reﬂects management’s assessment of cybersecurity risks.\\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board in the oversight and monitoring of cybersecurity matters. The Audit Committee regularly\\nreviews and discusses the Company’s cybersecurity risks with management, including the Company’s Head of Corporate\\nInformation Security, its General Counsel and the Heads of Compliance and Business Conduct, Business Assurance, and\\nInternal Audit, and receives updates, as necessary, regarding cybersecurity incidents.

As of September\\xa028, 2024, the Company owned or leased\\nfacilities and land for corporate functions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in\\nvarious places outside the U.S. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable\\nsegments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.\\nItem 3.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Legal Proceedings\\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the\\nCompany under the DMA. The Commission’s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how\\ndevelopers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as how\\ndevelopers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings,\\nuninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced its preliminary\\nﬁndings in the Article 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company’s App Store rules are in breach of the DMA and announced\\nthat it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company’s new contractual\\nrequirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA. If the Commission makes a ﬁnal\\ndetermination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose ﬁnes up to 10% of the\\nCompany’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the\\nEU, the effectiveness of the Commission’s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order\\nis granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in\\nresponse to feedback and engagement with the Commission.\\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general ﬁled a civil\\nantitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or\\nattempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in violation of U.S. antitrust laws.\\nThe DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters\\nhave been ﬁled in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary\\ndamages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend\\nitself.\\nEpic Games\\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) ﬁled a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California District\\nCourt”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based\\nupon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App\\nStore Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from\\nprohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than\\nApple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January\\n16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and ﬁled a statement of compliance with the California\\nDistrict Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the\\nCompany has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company ﬁled a motion with\\nthe California District Court to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to\\nvigorously defend itself.\\nOther Legal Proceedings\\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the\\nordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in\\nthe aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s ﬁnancial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is\\ninherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above\\nmanagement’s expectations, the Company’s ﬁnancial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially\\nadversely affected.'),\n",

The Company uses various\\nstrategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nThe Company is primarily exposed to ﬂuctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio\\nand term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase\\nthe interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative\\ninstruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any\\nassociated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September\\xa028, 2024 and\\nSeptember\\xa030, 2023 (dollars in millions):\\nInterest RateSensitive InstrumentHypothetical InterestRate Increase Potential Impact 2024 2023\\nInvestment portfolio100 basis points, all tenorsDecline in fair value $ 2,755\\xa0 $ 3,089\\xa0\\nTerm debt 100 basis points, all tenorsIncrease in annual interest expense$ 139\\xa0 $ 194\\xa0\\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other\\nthan the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the\\nCompany’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair\\nvalues of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use\\nderivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company\\nmay choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or\\nprohibitive cost.\\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of\\nﬂuctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair\\nvalue, for a given conﬁdence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in\\nrates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% conﬁdence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of\\n$538 million and $669 million as of September\\xa028, 2024 and September\\xa030, 2023, respectively.

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the\\nsigniﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s\\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over\\ntime as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer\\nof control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer\\nincentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the\\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”).\\nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are\\nestablished that reﬂect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they\\nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation\\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar\\nofferings, product-speciﬁc business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\\nThe Company has identiﬁed the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac\\nand iPad. The ﬁrst material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the\\nhardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive\\ncertain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri  and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any\\nrelated discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable\\nprices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue\\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which\\ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and\\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For\\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that\\nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not\\nrecognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the\\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when\\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product,\\nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party\\napplications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the\\ncustomer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in\\nServices net sales only the commission it retains.\\nNet sales disaggregated by signiﬁcant products and services for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):\\n2024 2023 2022\\niPhone $ 201,183\\xa0 $ 200,583\\xa0 $ 205,489\\xa0\\nMac 29,984\\xa0 29,357\\xa0 40,177\\xa0\\niPad 26,694\\xa0 28,300\\xa0 29,292\\xa0\\nWearables, Home and Accessories 37,005\\xa0 39,845\\xa0 41,241\\xa0\\nServices 96,169\\xa0 85,200\\xa0 78,129\\xa0\\nTotal net sales $ 391,035\\xa0 $ 383,285\\xa0 $ 394,328\\xa0\\n(1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.\\nTotal net sales include $7.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\\xa030,\\n® ®\\n(1)'),\n",

The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at\\nleast a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded\\naccrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with\\nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many\\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\\nshortage and signiﬁcant commodity pricing ﬂuctuations.\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by\\nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have\\nincreased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to\\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in\\nChina mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\\nNote 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Data\\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the\\nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Paciﬁc. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe\\nincludes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong\\nand Taiwan. Rest of Asia Paciﬁc includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable\\nsegments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is\\nmanaged separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique\\nmarket dynamics of each geographic region.\\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for\\ngeographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in\\nthose geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and\\noperating expenses directly attributable to the segment.

In our opinion, the ﬁnancial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the ﬁnancial position of the\\nCompany at September\\xa028, 2024 and September\\xa030, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash ﬂows for each of the\\nthree years in the period ended September\\xa028, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\\n(“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of September\\xa028, 2024, based on criteria established in\\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\\n(2013 framework) and our report dated November\\xa01, 2024 expressed an unqualiﬁed opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThese ﬁnancial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\\nthe Company’s ﬁnancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting ﬁrm registered with the PCAOB and are\\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due\\nto error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the ﬁnancial\\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements. Our audits also included\\nevaluating the accounting principles used and signiﬁcant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\\npresentation of the ﬁnancial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matter\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the ﬁnancial statements that\\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\\xa0relates to accounts or disclosures that\\nare material to the ﬁnancial statements and (2)\\xa0involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\\ncommunication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the ﬁnancial statements, taken as a whole,\\nand we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on\\nthe account or disclosure to which it relates.\\nUncertain Tax Positions\\nDescription of the Matter\\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the ﬁnancial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes\\nin the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. As of September\\xa028, 2024, the total amount\\nof gross unrecognized tax beneﬁts was $22.0 billion, of which $10.8 billion, if recognized,\\nwould impact the Company’s effective tax rate.

In our opinion, Apple Inc. (the “Company”) maintained, in all material respects, effective\\ninternal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of September\\xa028, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\\n(“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September\\xa028, 2024 and September\\xa030, 2023, the related\\nconsolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash ﬂows for each of the three years\\nin the period ended September\\xa0 28, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated November\\xa0 1, 2024 expressed an\\nunqualiﬁed opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over ﬁnancial reporting and for its\\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual\\nReport on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal\\ncontrol over ﬁnancial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting ﬁrm registered with the PCAOB and are required\\nto be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over ﬁnancial reporting was maintained in all\\nmaterial respects.\\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\\nweakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,\\nand performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a\\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\\nDeﬁnition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\\nreliability of ﬁnancial reporting and the preparation of ﬁnancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\\n(1)\\xa0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reﬂect the transactions and dispositions\\nof the assets of the company; (2)\\xa0 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\\npreparation of ﬁnancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\\ncompany; and (3)\\xa0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the ﬁnancial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over ﬁnancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nNovember\\xa01, 2024'),\n",

The Company’s\\ninternal control over ﬁnancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\\xa0\\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reﬂect the transactions and\\ndispositions of the Company’s assets;\\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of ﬁnancial\\nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in\\naccordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and\\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the ﬁnancial statements.\\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, does not expect that the Company’s\\ninternal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can\\nprovide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a\\ncontrol system must reﬂect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the beneﬁts of controls must be considered relative\\nto their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute\\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of\\ncontrols in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in\\nbusiness conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over ﬁnancial reporting\\n(as deﬁned in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the\\nCompany’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework\\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework).
